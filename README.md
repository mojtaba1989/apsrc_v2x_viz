# V2X Visualization Node

This repository contains a ROS (Robot Operating System) node for visualizing Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) in a V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication system. The node subscribes to BSM messages as well as GPS and IMU data to visualize the relative positions and orientations of detected objects.

## Dependencies
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- ROS packages:
  - `apsrc_msgs`
  - `geodesy`
  - `visualization_msgs`
  - `gps_common`
- C++11 or higher

## Installation
1. Make sure you have ROS installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository into your ROS workspace.
3. Build the ROS workspace using `catkin_make`.

## Usage
1. Launch your ROS environment.
2. Run the `v2x_viz_node` executable to start the visualization node:  
```rosrun apsrc_v2x_viz apsrc_v2x_viz_node```
3. Subscribe to the appropriate topics to provide BSM, GPS, and IMU data.

## Parameters
- `bsm_topic`: The topic for receiving Basic Safety Messages (default: `/v2x/BasicSafetyMessage`).
- `gps_topic`: The topic for receiving GPS data (default: `/gps/gps`).
- `imu_topic`: The topic for receiving IMU data (default: `/gps/imu`).
- `MA_gain`: Moving average gain used for smoothing yaw changes (default: `0.1`).

## Node Functionality
- Subscribes to BSM, GPS, and IMU messages.
- Visualizes detected objects as markers in a 3D space relative to the ego vehicle.
- Displays object IDs, headings, and position deltas.
